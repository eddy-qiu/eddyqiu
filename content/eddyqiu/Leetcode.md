In order to keep me accountable, I am going to start logging my Leetcode studies here. As of today, July 24, 2023, I have always been trying to commit to Leetcode and have only done a handful of problems.

Right now, I often take a long time with problems as well as understanding the solutions, and sometimes even have to learn python syntax.

- Completed [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/) problem - reattempt in a week
	- Bucket sort
	- python range(start, end, increment)

Some tools that I am using now are just Leetcode and Neetcode (free version). I might possibly get a premium course but I don't think that is too big of a requirement. I might also purchase Leetcode Premium in order to get company specific questions when I interview.
